# Lane-line-detection-
A lane line detection project uses computer vision techniques to identify lane markings on roads from images or video. It leverages image processing (like edge detection, region of interest, and Hough Transform) and machine learning for accurate lane tracking, enhancing autonomous driving systems and driver assistance technologies.
